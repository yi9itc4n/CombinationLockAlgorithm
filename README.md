# CombinationLockAlgorithm
This code creates a random linked list in the specified length. Then randomly chooses an element and determines that as the common one on all 3 lists and fills the other lists with random numbers.  Then the algorithm finds the shortest way to match those 3 common values according to the first one and then shares the steps with user.
